#
# The following variables can be used to tweak parallel execution of
# various aspects of CalculiX CrunchiX.
# For examples of their usage, please see the documentation!
#

# OMP_NUM_THREADS is a general purpose variable to specify the number
# of cores to be used in parallel.
OMP_NUM_THREADS="8"

# Any of the variables declared below can be used for special purposes
# to override the values of OMP_NUM_THREADS. If any of them is declared,
# it will take precedence over OMP_NUM_THREADS

# CCX_NPROC_STIFFNESS is used when creating element stiffness matrices
# in parallel. Default is 1.
#CCX_NPROC_STIFFNESS="1"

# CCX_NPROC_EQUATION_SOLVER is used to solve the system of equations using
# the multithreaded version of sci-libs/spooles. Default is 1.
#CCX_NPROC_EQUATION_SOLVER="1"

# CCX_NPROC_RESULTS is used to create material tangent matrices and 
# calculate the stresses at integration points in parallel. Default is 1.
#CCX_NPROC_RESULTS="1"

# CCX_NPROC_VIEWFACTOR is used to calculate the viewfactors for thermal
# radiation computations in parallel. Default is 1.
#CCX_NPROC_VIEWFACTOR="1"

# CCX_NPROC_CFD is used to perform several operations in CFD calculations
# (computational fluid dynamics) in parallel. Default is 1.
#CCX_NPROC_CFD="1"

# CCX_NPROC_BIOTSAVART is used to calculate the magnetic intensity by use
# of the Biot-Savart law in parallel. Default is 1.
#CCX_NPROC_BIOTSAVART="1"

# CalculiX CrunchiX detects the number of available cores in many cases by
# using a sysconf call. If this fails or does not work correctly for any 
# reason, you can use NUMBER_OF_CPUS to override this value
#NUMBER_OF_CPUS="8"
